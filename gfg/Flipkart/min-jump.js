/**
 * Given an array of N integers arr[] where each element represents the maximum length of the jump 
 * that can be made forward from that element. This means if arr[i] = x, then we can jump any distance y such that y â‰¤ x.
 * Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). 
 * If an element is 0, then you cannot move through that element.
 * Note: Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.
